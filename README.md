Give your app a taste of clarity. **SentiMint** is a minimalistic `ASP.NET` + `ML.NET` powered API that chews through human opinions and tells you what they really feel—positive, negative (somewhere in between will be future :)). 

Built for devs who care about the romantic scenario = {**backend elegance**} + {**machine learning magic**} - {**front-end fluff**}.

Plug it into your app. Feed it your users’ words. Get insight that actually speaks.
